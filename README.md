Rust Mini Project
This is a Rust implementation of the "sort colors" algorithm, which sorts an array of integers containing only 0's, 1's, and 2's. It uses a three-pointer approach to swap elements and sort the array in linear time.

Installation
To run this program, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download Rust from the official website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Usage
To run the program, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command in the terminal:

arduino
Copy code
cargo run
This will compile and run the program, which will sort the example array [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0] and print the sorted array.
In this example, the result will be [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
